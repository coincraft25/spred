# Spred Protocol — README

**"Spred it before it happens."**  
*A decentralized protocol for timestamped prediction — built to be unstoppable.*

Spred is an open-source, permissionless protocol for creating, resolving, and tracking public belief. It transforms human prediction into measurable, verifiable signal — recorded onchain and rewarded through reputation and fixed-supply token emissions.

This repository contains the protocol specification, core architecture, and contribution standards.
